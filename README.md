# PRODIGY_DS_01
# Introduction 
This task demonstrates basic data manipulation and visualization techniques using Python. We will create sample datasets for both categorical and continuous variables and visualize them using bar charts and histograms. The primary libraries used are `pandas` for data manipulation, and `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
# Challenges
# Data Generation: 
Creating representative sample data for both categorical and continuous variables can be challenging. Ensuring the data is realistic and covers various cases is essential for meaningful visualizations.
# Visualization: 
Choosing the correct type of visualization to effectively represent the data. Bar charts are suitable for categorical data, while histograms are better for continuous data.
# Library Usage: 
Properly utilizing pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations can be difficult for beginners. Understanding the syntax and capabilities of these libraries is crucial.
